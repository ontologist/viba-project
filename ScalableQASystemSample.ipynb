For testing purposes. [`ElasticsearchDocumentStore`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/reference/document-store-api#module-elasticsearch) is a fast and scalable text-focused storage option. [`FAISSDocumentStore`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/reference/document-store-api#module-faiss) is a DocumentStore for very large-scale, embedding-based dense Retrievers, like the DPR.  Both services runs independently from Haystack and persists even after the Haystack program has finished running.  The DocumentStore support different types of external databases. See this for more information: [DocumentStore](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/document_store)."

With the compact and lightweight ASUS L410, productivity is always within reach. It easily slips into a backpack so you can create content anywhere. A cleverly designed 180 lay-flat hinge makes it easy to share content or collaborate with friends. The innovative thin-bezel NanoEdge display provides more usable screen space. It also enables a larger screen to fit into a smaller chassis. L410 comes with a backlit keyboard with long key travel and a large 6-inch multitouch pad with palm-rejection technology, offering an excellent experience.

Although the HP has a larger screen, it doesn't look as good as the Acer's because it has an extremely cool color temperature that gives the image a bluish tint. In terms of processing power, the HP has better single-threaded and graphical performance, but the Acer performs better in multi-threaded workloads. Battery life is about the same for both laptops if you're only doing light productivity tasks like web browsing, though the Acer lasts longer for video playback and gaming.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6874013007975054, 'meta': {'_split_id': 13}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '88e1c6c1aace4dc13ed31501d738131f'}>,\n",
